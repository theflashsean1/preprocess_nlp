"Once again, the brunt of the snowfall will be during the afternoon and evening hours," says Environment Canada in a special weather statement. "Eastern parts of the Avalon Peninsula will likely receive the highest snowfall totals, with potential for another 5 to 10 cm or more before tapering off New Year's Eve night."
Strong west-southwest winds are likely later New Year's Eve night after the snow tapers off, which could kick up freshly fallen snow through the overnight.
Looking ahead, it will remain below seasonal through the middle of next week, with daytime highs in the minus single digits.

Nor'easter next week
"High impact nor'easter for Atlantic Canada late Thursday, Thursday night and into Friday," says The Weather Network meteorologist Dr. Doug Gillham.
"Rapidly intensifying system will track offshore of the U.S. East Coast during the middle of the week, but potentially close enough to bring some snow to areas near the coast. The system will track north into the Maritimes as a strong storm, with the potential for a blizzard for New Brunswick and strong winds and heavy rain for eastern Maritimes. Snow and ice will likely change to rain for much of Newfoundland."
